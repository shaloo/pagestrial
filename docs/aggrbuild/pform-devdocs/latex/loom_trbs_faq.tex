\section{What Apps will be available when Loom launches in summer 2018?}
\label{\detokenize{loom_trbs_faq:what-apps-will-be-available-when-loom-launches-in-summer-2018}}
SaaS Information Map, DataVision, GDPR Readiness and GDPR Subject Access Request (SAR) apps will be available at launch.

The SaaS Information Map App will be included in Data Management 360 suites and will also be available on its own - just as Information Map was previously. All existing Information Map customers will be entitled to (and migrated to) the Information Map App. The Information Map App will include all functionality present in Information Map as of the Loom launch date.

The SaaS DataVision App will be available for separate purchase from other apps on Loom. It will include all the functionality of the Information Map App. It will also include Information Classification, built-in actions and some features found in Data Insight 6 as well as workflows to solve business challenges like data center consolidation.

The SaaS GDPR Readiness App will be available for separate purchase from other apps on Loom. It builds on the output of the DataVision App with GDPR-specific workflows. These workflows are designed to simplify GDPR readiness and help with more a comprehensive understanding of personal data when responding to Subject Access Requests (SARs).

The SaaS GDPR Subject Access Request (SAR) App will be available for separate purchase from other apps on Loom. Its capabilities will be enhanced if purchased together with the SaaS GDPR Readiness App. It will include workflows designed to streamline SAR requests, providing significant value in locating and identifying personal data in unstructured data repositories.


\section{Will there be any functionality loss when Information Map and Data Insight are rolled into one product?}
\label{\detokenize{loom_trbs_faq:will-there-be-any-functionality-loss-when-information-map-and-data-insight-are-rolled-into-one-product}}
It’s likely that we won’t put all Data Insight functionality into Loom apps \textendash{} we’re working on mapping this so that we can be fully transparent on this point. We plan to implement use cases that are relevant and valuable to our customers and prospects into Loom apps rather than simply copying all Data Insight features/functionality. In addition, the plan for the platform includes functionality not available in Data Insight, such as visibility into additional data sources and built-in actions.


\section{Will Data Insight be able to look at NetBackup catalog data?}
\label{\detokenize{loom_trbs_faq:will-data-insight-be-able-to-look-at-netbackup-catalog-data}}
We have no plans to integrate Data Insight with the NetBackup catalog at this time. Loom will have visibility into NetBackup catalog data.


\section{When will the On-Premises version of Loom be released?}
\label{\detokenize{loom_trbs_faq:when-will-the-on-premises-version-of-loom-be-released}}
We are currently targeting July 2018 for SKU availability (transactability) for the SaaS version of Loom. We expect the fully On-Premises version of Loom to be available in the second half of calendar 2018.

\section{Introduction}
\label{\detokenize{loom_trbs_faq:introduction}}
Use this information to learn about sizing a typical Loom deployment on Microsoft Azure in a SaaS model.

Veritas Loom is a Digital Information Management Platform that comprises of the core Loom Services that make the Platform and Loom Applications.  In the initial release, two Loom Applications are available:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
DataVision - Provides complete visibility into an enterprise’s structured and unstructured data through enterprise configurable data classification and access policies

\item {} 
GDPR - Offers basic coverage for enterprise GDPR readiness and compliance

\end{itemize}

Enterprises can visualize, classify and gain insights into their data irrespective of where it is located - in the cloud or on premises.  For analyzing data on premises, enterprises are required to deploy an on premises Loom Data Engine component.  Such an additional component is not required to analyze cloud based enterprise data.  For sizing details related to Loom On Premises Data Engine Deployment, refer to the {\hyperref[\detokenize{loom_trbs_faq:ht-loom-op-de-sizing}]{\sphinxcrossref{\DUrole{std,std-ref}{How-to Size On Premises Loom Data Engine Deployment}}}}.


\section{Deployment Overview}
\label{\detokenize{loom_trbs_faq:deployment-overview}}
This section will give a very high level system diagram indicating key Loom components that get deployed in Microsoft Azure.  This is for cloud based Loom Deployment Option. The most frequently asked questions about Loom Deployment are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
How do I size it?

\item {} 
What will it cost me?

\end{itemize}

Loom Sizing depends on two key factors:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
What are the typical enterprise needs regarding security, availability and desired performance levels for enterprise data scanning for gaining visibility and access control?

\item {} 
Availability of Loom Performance Matrix that captures key Loom Digital Information Management functionality, given a specific number of enterprise users, overall enterprise data size that needs to be scanned and analyzed, the frequency of scans, number of enterprise data sources, shared storage type and many others.

\end{itemize}

Performance and costs are related. Many of the factors listed above contribute to the blueprint that could offer best options based on costs for Loom Deployment sizing on Azure in terms of storage, storage transactions, networking, and other enterprise needs.

Following figure captures a typical Loom Deployment on Microsoft Azure.


\section{Pre-requisites for Loom Deployment on Azure}
\label{\detokenize{loom_trbs_faq:pre-requisites-for-loom-deployment-on-azure}}
This section lists pre-requisites for Loom Deployment on Azure that need to be considered for Loom Sizing.

If you are looking at actual Loom Deployment on Azure, refer to the specific instructions in \DUrole{xref,std,std-ref}{file\_cloud\_azure\_dep\_guide}.

Following is a list of key information points that you need to be ready with.  These vary from organization to organization and based on some of these factors, Loom Deployment Sizing may vary.
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Hardware Considerations

\item {} 
Software Considerations

\item {} 
Networking Considerations

\item {} 
Security Considerations

\item {} 
High Availability Considerations

\item {} 
Total number of Customers that need to be supported by a Loom Deployment in terms of total Tenants, number of Loom Users per Tenant , and total number of concurrent users of Loom Deployment

\item {} 
Total Enterprise Content Repository Numbers,

\item {} 
Total Data (bytes) per Enterprise Content repository

\item {} 
Expected Information Classification Scan Performance or typical time window to complete a scan

\end{itemize}


\section{Sizing: Loom SaaS Deployment on Azure}
\label{\detokenize{loom_trbs_faq:sizing-loom-saas-azure}}\label{\detokenize{loom_trbs_faq:sizing-loom-saas-deployment-on-azure}}
Loom requires minimum 8 nodes with at least 30GB Memory to support 10 Tenants per Customer through a Azure based SaaS deployment. There may be additional nodes needed in case on-premises data sources have to be connected to Loom deployment in the cloud. That may need to deploy additional nodes on premises for setting up an on-premises Loom Data Engine component. Refer to \sphinxhref{http://10.67.141.149/shaloo/aggr/pform-ugdocs/html/on\_prem\_dp\_install\_mcdmp.html\#ing-com-on-prem-dp-install}{Loom On-Premise Data Plane Deployment} for instructions on how to set up and on premises Loom Data Engine for gaining visibility or classifying data located on premises. For sizing the Loom On Premises Data Engine Deployment, refer to {\hyperref[\detokenize{loom_trbs_faq:ht-loom-op-de-sizing}]{\sphinxcrossref{\DUrole{std,std-ref}{How-to Size On Premises Loom Data Engine Deployment}}}}.

Loom is delivered in its first release as a Microsoft Azure based SaaS offering managed by Veritas. Security is the most critical and important consideration for cloud based services. There are several aspects of security including secure connections, encryption of data in motion and controlled, authorized access to data at rest. This document contains some of the frequently asked questions related to Loom Security by early adopters.


\section{What are the high level security principles of Loom Platform and its Applications?}
\label{\detokenize{loom_trbs_faq:what-are-the-high-level-security-principles-of-loom-platform-and-its-applications}}
Veritas Loom Platform and Application Ecosystem ensures that all communication between different components and sub-systems is secured using industry standard encryption protocols. Loom architecture is designed to be a multi-tenant system from ground up. For each tenant, an encrypted filesystem is created at the time of tenant creation to secure the data at rest. Loom ensures that the encryption key used is unique for each tenant. Loom core platform comprises of a dedicated micro-service for tenant key management functionality.


\section{Does Loom support secured sign on?}
\label{\detokenize{loom_trbs_faq:does-loom-support-secured-sign-on}}
Yes. Administrative and end-user accounts can be managed using Loom Admin Dashboard. Not yet integrated with other Identity Management Services such as Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS).


\section{Does it support Role Based Access Control?}
\label{\detokenize{loom_trbs_faq:does-it-support-role-based-access-control}}
Loom offers Role Based Access control such that Administrative accounts can be segregated from the Loom user accounts.


\section{Does Loom Platform and its Applications store any Customer data?}
\label{\detokenize{loom_trbs_faq:does-loom-platform-and-its-applications-store-any-customer-data}}
Yes.

TBD - List of Metadata stored by Loom


\section{Data Residency Considerations for Loom}
\label{\detokenize{loom_trbs_faq:data-residency-considerations-for-loom}}
TBD - In what physical locations does the Customer data get stored in Loom SaaS deployment Context?  Is it in EMEA or elsewhere? One location or multiple locations?


\section{Physical Data Security Considerations}
\label{\detokenize{loom_trbs_faq:physical-data-security-considerations}}
TBD - Veritas Loom is deployed using a third party Cloud Provider service.  What all data security standards are complied to by that provider?  List all the ones supported by Azure cloud from amongst - say ISO 27001, ISO 9001, SOC, the PCI Data Security Standard and the US Government’s Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP).


\section{What are the technical controls for Loom infrastructure, Application and Data Security policies?}
\label{\detokenize{loom_trbs_faq:what-are-the-technical-controls-for-loom-infrastructure-application-and-data-security-policies}}
The following technical controls support Loom infrastructure, application, and data security policies.

\sphinxstylestrong{Infrastructure Security:}
TBD - Firewalls, Virtual Private Clouds (VPC), Load Balancers

\sphinxstylestrong{Application Security:}
TBD - Role Based Access Control, User Session persistence and cookies (does Loom support it for June release?), Audit Logs and History

\sphinxstylestrong{Data Security:}
Data in transit - Encryption is supported. All data sent to or retrieved from the Loom Azure based SaaS deployment is over HTTPS; encrypted and secured using Transport Layer Security (TLS). This security mechanism covers Loom Platform and Application users that interact with the system through a browser as well as the data transferred between on-premise Loom Data Engine and Loom SaaS deployment. This includes the metadata uploaded by the Loom On Premises Data Engine and configuration information that is retrieved by it.

Data at rest - All customer data in the Veritas Loom deployment is encrypted at rest Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption. This applies to all customer data whether uploaded, entered via the web application or generated data such as exports.

TBD - Need to verify how this is taken care of by Loom - whether there is PPOD / tenant specific keys (I think)

Each customer is randomly allocated a unique 256-bit AES master key which is used to encrypt and protect the keys used for actual data encryption, which are 128-bit AES keys. The master key is generated by and stored within a physical Key Management System. The master key can never leave the KMS and hence is kept separate from the encrypted data.

Multiple 128-bit AES keys are used to encrypt data within different repositories, such as databases and Object Storage. For example, each batch of metadata uploaded from the on-premise Loom Data Engine is assigned a new, randomly generated 128-bit AES key. The batch is then encrypted before being stored in Object Storage for subsequent processing.
