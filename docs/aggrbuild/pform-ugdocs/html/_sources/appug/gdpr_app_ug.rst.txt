.. note:: Loom Application Availability

  The GDPR Application is not available in Loom Alpha2 Release.

The European Union (EU) made an impact across the globe with passage of the GDPR in May 2016. When it goes into effect on May 25, 2018, all companies—including international firms—doing business with individuals located in EU member nation territory must comply with the law’s far-reaching provisions. Failure to act quickly to prepare for the regulation could have serious consequences—to an organization’s bottom line, customer relationships and brand image.

Veritas Loom is a Multi-Cloud Data Management Platform for enterprise data analysis and management. The Alpha2 version of Loom offers in-built Loom application called 360 Data Analysis and Loom Dashboard.  360 Data Analysis Application provides visibility & data classification functions. Other Loom applications will be available in future releases.  The GDPR Application is designed to help enterprises identify data related vulnerabilities, mitigate risks and take actions for remediation and compliance with data privacy regulations in a scalable and reliable manner.

This user guide outline is Work in progress.
