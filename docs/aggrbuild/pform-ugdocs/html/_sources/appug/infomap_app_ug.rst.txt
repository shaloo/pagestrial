.. note:: Loom Application Availability

  The Information Map Application is not available in Loom Alpha2 Release. There is a 360 Data Analysis Application that provides visibility into enterprise content repositories and data classification for a handful of supported content sources.  Going forward, Loom Product will have Veritas Information Map deployed on Loom.  In addition, it will also have a separate application called Information Studio.  Information Map is targeted at the Storage and IT Admins whereas Information Studio is targeted at business users and executives who need a way to understand their enterprise data landscape, manage risks associated with enterprise data assets and obtain insights for data center consolidation.

This user guide outline is Work in progress.
