  Loom Platform Management Guide
#################################

This document describes how Loom Partner and Tenant admins can use the Loom Platform UI for various business functions such as gaining visibility into enterprise wide data assets, data scan policies, data access policies and more.

.. note::

   Post Alpha2 release of Loom, this new Guide may get added as a new Loom User Guide.  We plan to restructure the content based on end to end reviews with qualified writers. Until then, the new updated content created as part of Alpha2 Loom Release can be referred to via the links below.  This is a stop-gap / trial arrangement until we figure out a way to bridge the Vasont based authoring system with DocX one and can utilize both to the fullest potential as per the Loom Platform Documetation requirements and strategy for *Shared Documentation Development Model*.
