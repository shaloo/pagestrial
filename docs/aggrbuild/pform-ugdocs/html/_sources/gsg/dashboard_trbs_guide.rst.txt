====================
1. User Role Errors
====================

The empty navigation panel on LHS of Dashboard, under the title 'App Policies', indicates issues with the user role and action that is being tried out using Loom Platform dashboard.  This error is encountered when the Platform microservice for identity and access management (IDM) does not return any links pertaining to user actions due to role errors.

2. Missing Applications
=======================

If you don't see any applications listed under the 'Apps' tab on LHS of the navigation pane, it could either mean that the required steps to deploy applications on Loom Platform were not followed during Platform deployment by the Platform Admin or the Tenant Admin. It can be deployed by either of these roles later by clicking the Manager App icon under the 'Platform' user interface on the LHS navigation panel.

3. Microservice Down
=======================

If you don't see any chart or statistics in the Dashboard pertaining to one or more Platform Micro services, it is probably caused due to some error in micro-service that impacts its health. In such cases you can refer to micro-services status page to see its health and latest status indicating whether it is up, how much resource consumption is happening by this micro service and more.
