**********************************
Loom Alpha2 User Registration
**********************************

Loom registration process requires customers to fill out a Loom Alpha2 `Registration form`_. A provisioning team member from Veritas validates the Registration form and verifies that all necessary information is present.
Based on the data provided in this form, the provisioning team member then begins the on-boarding process for the specific customer by creating a Customer Admin user for the organization. The provisioning team also adds the public IP addresses provided in the Registration form to a white list of IP addresses. These IP addresses are used to access the Loom Control Plane from the customer's environment.

The provisioning team member must be a user with the Partner Admin role in the Alpha2 deployment for Veritas Loom.

**To create a Customer Admin user:**

#. Log in to the Loom UI with Partner Admin credentials.

#. In the left navigation pane, click **Organizations** > **Customers**.

#. Click **Add**.
   Based on the information present in Registration form, enter the following details:

   * Customer name. If the form indicates a desired default tenant name, it is changed accordingly.
   * First name, last name, and email address of the Customer Admin
   * The billing ID. This value is at this point notional, enter any numeric value.

#. Click **Save** to create a Customer Admin user.
    A success message indicates the creation of a customer account and the assignment of Customer Admin role.

Once the Customer Admin user is created in Veritas Loom under his customer, the user receives a welcome email with the Customer Admin account credentials. The Customer Admin user must click the link in the email to initiate the process to set the password.

Once password is reset, the Customer Admin can access the Veritas Loom interface by launching the URL given in provisioning form.

There are Loom Alpha2 Terms and Conditions that every customer organization needs to be aware of. For details refer to the document here. TBD <David Corbin is working on this, to be plugged in as a link>

****************************
Loom SaaS Deployment Access
****************************

The Alpha2 Release of Loom is available as an Azure-based SaaS deployment.  In future releases, deployment of Loom on premises or in a hybrid mode will be supported. Veritas owns the SaaS deployment of Loom. It is setup in the US West Zone of Azure cloud. In future, there may be other partners who may host similar Loom setups for their clients using Azure or a different cloud provider.

Once the organization receives its Customer Admin account credentials and the link for accessing Loom, the Customer Admin must login using the credentials to create at least one Tenant Admin account for the organization. The Customer Admin can only manage Tenant Admin accounts. They do not have access to Tenant User accounts. Also, for security reasons, Loom Admin account operated by Veritas or its partner, can only manage Customer Accounts. They cannot access and Tenant Admin or Tenant User accounts.  For every organization, the Tenant User accounts are managed by Tenant Admins.

The Tenant Admin is responsible for completing the following Loom usage pre-requisites for every organization:

#.  Setting up of on-premises Loom Data Plane (Not required if the Loom platform is used to analyze cloud-based content sources.)
    This step is required to enable organizations to connect their on premises or private cloud content sources to Loom in order to use Loom features such as 360 Data Analysis for data visibility and classification purpose.

#.  Creating organization specific Tenant User accounts. These Tenant users can access all organization specific content sources and obtain necessary insights related to enterprise information governance and control.

#.  Accessing applications to add content sources and to analyze the data. Note that in Alpha2 release of Loom, there are two in built applications - Loom UI and 360 Data Analysis.  In future, there may be more applications and based on the subscription, Tenant Admins may choose to deploy additional Loom applications.

#.  Setting up enterprise specific content classification policies.  Note that in Alpha2 release of Loom, there may be limited capability for Policy customization.

*************************
Other Loom Pre-requisites
*************************

* Ensure that the services are up and running.
* Health check whether the on-premises data plane and connected content sources are operating normally in Loom.

********************************
How to use Loom to analyze data
********************************

* Tenant Admin or Tenant User logs in to the Veritas Connection Center to add credentials and connections to on-premises and cloud based content sources.

* Enable content sources in the 360 Data Analysis app to begin fetching metadata for these content sources.

* If classifying repositories, initiate the classification action.

* Analyze your organization's data.
