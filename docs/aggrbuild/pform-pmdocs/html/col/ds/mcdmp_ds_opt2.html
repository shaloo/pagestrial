<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Digital transformation waves are steadily eroding the boundaries between Consumer and Enterprise Software realms. Applications are the primary guiding forces in data center infrastructure design. To gain competitive advantage, enterprises are using dynamic applications that not only integrate with other business applications but processes as well. These modern data crunching applications utilize technologies such as containerization, micro-services and workload mobility.  In addition, they are bringing about technological shifts through newer data access traffic patterns that are mostly horizontal inter-app traffic rather than the traditional top down app to storage data access.</p>
<p>Enterprises often struggle to reorient and align with these industry shifts as they have a variety of complex infrastructures. For them, bringing several disparate systems together can be a challenge, especially where different functions “own” and have developed them in some degree of isolation. Often, many designated data owners within an enterprise do not have real access to data or clear visibility into their data sets or their historical contexts. What they require is a seamless layer that intermediates between related and interdependent application workflows and enterprise data access needs. Such a layer can facilitate information sharing, analytics and actionable insights while efficiently using common resources.  There is a continuous tension between retaining control of enterprise data assets and scalability while maintaining simple yet productive user experience of information governance.</p>
<p>Loom - the Veritas multi-cloud data management platform is designed to address these challenges comprehensively by providing an end-to-end, unified, scalable, robust and flexible platform ecosystem to govern and monetize enterprise information assets. It enables enterprises to gain visibility into their data sets through a robust, scalable framework which can help facilitate application cooperation and resource sharing. Its multi-tenant, scalable, micro-service driven architecture can help enterprises achieve complete visibility into their data assets and comprehensive information governance.</p>

<h2>Product Deployment Model &amp; Scale<a class="headerlink" href="#product-deployment-model-scale" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Loom offers a flexible deployment model to suit enterprise business needs and budgets. It is designed and validated to support (TBD based on actuals from Engineering) say Exabytes of data, thousands of concurrent accesses and more - TBD. Enterprises can use any of the supported deployment models listed below:</p>
<p><strong>On Premise:</strong> Enterprises with heavy investment in an on-premise infrastructure and stringent privacy requirements could choose this model and set up the control as well as data planes within their firewall.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Deploymenta</strong>: Loom can be setup either in a private cloud deployment model or as a multi-tenanted MSP setup which can be used by several customers such as small enterprises who do not wish to make any infrastructure investments.</p>
<p><strong>Hybrid:</strong> Depending upon the business needs, enterprises could choose to setup the Loom Control plane on premise while the data planes can reside in the cloud for scale and efficiency.</p>

<h2>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Loom, the Veritas multi-cloud data management platform empowers enterprise information governance principals with the information they need, when they need it. It can help enterprises gain visibility and scour their data assets in a unified, policy driven manner to obtain highly targeted information. Such in-depth insights cannot be obtained from analyzing standalone data asset. Through intelligent machine learning, metadata analysis and data usage pattern analytics, it can help turn unstructured dark data into information that enterprises can benefit from, not only to address regulatory compliance but also to monetize the actionable insights into newer streams of revenue. Its intuitive yet simple, unified Dashboard helps increase productivity, reduce operating costs and minimize risk related to enterprise data assets.. para_ds_summary:</p>
