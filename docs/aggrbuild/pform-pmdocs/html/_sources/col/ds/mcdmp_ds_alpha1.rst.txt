.. para_overview:

In today’s data and information centric era, many enterprises are embracing multiple clouds and machine learning and artificial intelligence to gain deep insights from their data to adapt business models, improves operations and build new products and customer engagement models. Gartner predicts that 15 Zettabytes of data will be created annually by 2020 while 90%+ of it will be in the cloud.  To cope up with this ever-increasing data, organizations are leveraging multiple private and public clouds, SaaS, cloud storage and traditional storage solutions. Data that is being collected and stored is also changing from structured to semi-structured and unstructured. Organizations’ data and storage environment is becoming complex and diverse, and will be unmanageable. 

Many organizations are looking for digital information management solutions that can control costs while managing this complex data environment, provide visibility and deeper insights into their data, and meet regulations while governing and securing the data. Current solutions are point products that are built prior to cloud and web scale technologies. These are difficult to deploy and manage and do not offer a unified digital information management platform to address customer challenges.  

Veritas Multi-Cloud Data Management Platform is industry’s first intelligent unified platform that helps organizations to address all of the data related challenges by providing a comprehensive set of applications and services, and a platform that is web scale, and enables 3rd party applications to govern and eventually monetize enterprise information assets. 

Figure below gives a high-level view of the Veritas Multi-Cloud Data Management Platform.

=================================
Unique Benefits of Loom Platform 
=================================

* Rich set of Applications and Services - include Veritas Data Management and Governance apps and other 3rd party apps
* Unparalleled Visibility with Unified Policy and Security across entire organization’s data irrespective of its location  , type and store 
* Single Pane of Control and Management through a unified dashboard across applications

These benefits are delivered through three components – Intelligent Unified Platform, Applications and Data Services, and a Single Point of Control and Management.

-----------------------------
Intelligent Unified Platform
-----------------------------
* Abstracts out underlying data environment through a Unified Connection Framework for all content sources 
  across Private  , Public Clouds, Cloud Storage, Traditional and Legacy storage
* Builds a unified asset database of the entire organization’s data to provide Google-like search with 
  automated aggregations
* Common identity and access management, policy and security across the entire data
* Provides a comprehensive set of APIs to quickly develop new applications or business specific work flows by
  3rd party and customers
* Enables intelligent and deeper insights into data using ML/AI capabilities 

-----------------------------
Applications & Data Services
-----------------------------
* Applications to address data governance, compliance & risk management, data management, data security, data protection, data loss prevention needs
* 3rd party applications for vertical specific needs
* Workflows that span multiple apps or meet specific business needs
* Real Time Predictive Analytics
* Though alpha release includes only the following apps, the solution at Release 1.0 will include several other apps such as GDPR (Readiness, SAR, DAR)
  - DataVision App includes key capabilities of InfoMap to provide visibility, Data Insights to provide ownerships, information and user risks, classification, policy and actions. Initial alpha release will have visibility and classification of data sources

-------------------------------------
Single Point of Control & Management
-------------------------------------
* Single window into all the data irrespective of location, type and store
* Single dashboard for all Veritas and 3rd Party Applications
* Single point for license management
* Single place for all Access and Security policies
* Automate Workflow Orchestration

Loom Platform is offered as a service (SaaS) in Release 1.0. In future releases, it will be offered in an appliance form-factor, as a VMware based virtual appliance, to run in on-premises deployments. The solution does not  move the customer data from its original location. Instead it offers a local data engine to connect with data sources for gathering metadata and other intelligence about the data. This data engine can be deployed on-premises (VMWare) or in public clouds (AWS, Azure) wherever the data is located.
