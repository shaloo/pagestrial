==================================
ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
==================================

Digital revolution has bombarded businesses with ever multiplying new workloads and processes that generate huge amounts of structured as well as unstructured data on a daily basis. Companies spend increasing amount of resources on storing, managing and archiving this data while only a small fraction of it is actually utilized more than once. Within these unexplored realms of dark data lies tremendous potential to create newer avenues for business revenue as well as the data minefields. Such data minefields could explode unexpectedly, triggered by newer regulations and compliance demands for data privacy and security, causing heavy penalties for the business.

Today, most enterprises simply use data to support businesses rather than as an enabler for illumination, deriving information or gaining knowledge for growth and optimization. Their key challenges include wide distribution span of enterprise data sets on premise and in the cloud, absence of capabilities that can reliably handle data at scale, and obtaining visibility into data location, access patterns, data classification in order to determine its business relevance and value. What is needed here is a shift in approach - from infrastructure-centric to a strategic data-centric model is needed as enterprises deal with data security, privacy regulations, and use analytics to generate improved business insights hat is needed is a that works in tandem with enterprise move to multi-cloud environments, to better prevent and recover from cyber attacks, comply with new data privacy regulations, and to use analytics to generate improved business insights.
