In today’s data and information centric era, many enterprises are embracing multiple clouds and machine learning and artificial intelligence to gain deep insights from their data to adapt business models, improves operations and build new products and customer engagement models. Gartner predicts that 15 Zettabytes of data will be created annually by 2020 while 90\%+ of it will be in the cloud.  To cope up with this ever-increasing data, organizations are leveraging multiple private and public clouds, SaaS, cloud storage and traditional storage solutions. Data that is being collected and stored is also changing from structured to semi-structured and unstructured. Organizations’ data and storage environment is becoming complex and diverse, and will be unmanageable.

Many organizations are looking for digital information management solutions that can control costs while managing this complex data environment, provide visibility and deeper insights into their data, and meet regulations while governing and securing the data. Current solutions are point products that are built prior to cloud and web scale technologies. These are difficult to deploy and manage and do not offer a unified digital information management platform to address customer challenges.

Veritas Multi-Cloud Data Management Platform is industry’s first intelligent unified platform that helps organizations to address all of the data related challenges by providing a comprehensive set of applications and services, and a platform that is web scale, and enables 3rd party applications to govern and eventually monetize enterprise information assets.

Figure below gives a high-level view of the Veritas Multi-Cloud Data Management Platform.

\item {} 
Rich set of Applications and Services - include Veritas Data Management and Governance apps and other 3rd party apps

\item {} 
Unparalleled Visibility with Unified Policy and Security across entire organization’s data irrespective of its location  , type and store

\item {} 
Single Pane of Control and Management through a unified dashboard across applications

\end{itemize}

These benefits are delivered through three components \textendash{} Intelligent Unified Platform, Applications and Data Services, and a Single Point of Control and Management.


\subsection{Intelligent Unified Platform}

- DataVision App includes key capabilities of InfoMap to provide visibility, Data Insights to provide ownerships, information and user risks, classification, policy and actions. Initial alpha release will have visibility and classification of data sources

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Single Point of Control \& Management}
\label{\detokenize{col/ds/mcdmp_ds_alpha1:single-point-of-control-management}}\begin{itemize}

Loom Platform is offered as a service (SaaS) in Release 1.0. In future releases, it will be offered in an appliance form-factor, as a VMware based virtual appliance, to run in on-premises deployments. The solution does not  move the customer data from its original location. Instead it offers a local data engine to connect with data sources for gathering metadata and other intelligence about the data. This data engine can be deployed on-premises (VMWare) or in public clouds (AWS, Azure) wherever the data is located.


\section{Key Platform Concepts}
\label{\detokenize{col/ds/mcdmp_ds_alpha1:key-platform-concepts}}
