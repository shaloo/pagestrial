\label{\detokenize{col/ds/mcdmp_ds_opt1:title-ds-option1}}\label{\detokenize{col/ds/mcdmp_ds_opt1:enterprise-information-management}}\label{\detokenize{col/ds/mcdmp_ds_opt1:mcdmp-ds-opt1}}\label{\detokenize{col/ds/mcdmp_ds_opt1:datasheet-loom-the-multi-cloud-enterprise-data-management-platform-ecosystem-opt1}}
Digital revolution has bombarded businesses with ever multiplying new workloads and processes that generate huge amounts of structured as well as unstructured data on a daily basis. Companies spend increasing amount of resources on storing, managing and archiving this data while only a small fraction of it is actually utilized more than once. Within these unexplored realms of dark data lies tremendous potential to create newer avenues for business revenue as well as the data minefields. Such data minefields could explode unexpectedly, triggered by newer regulations and compliance demands for data privacy and security, causing heavy penalties for the business.

Today, most enterprises simply use data to support businesses rather than as an enabler for illumination, deriving information or gaining knowledge for growth and optimization. Their key challenges include wide distribution span of enterprise data sets on premise and in the cloud, absence of capabilities that can reliably handle data at scale, and obtaining visibility into data location, access patterns, data classification in order to determine its business relevance and value. What is needed here is a shift in approach - from infrastructure-centric to a strategic data-centric model is needed as enterprises deal with data security, privacy regulations, and use analytics to generate improved business insights hat is needed is a that works in tandem with enterprise move to multi-cloud environments, to better prevent and recover from cyber attacks, comply with new data privacy regulations, and to use analytics to generate improved business insights.

\section{PROTECT, GOVERN \& MONETIZE ENTERPRISE DATA ASSETS ON PREMISE AND IN THE CLOUD}
\label{\detokenize{col/ds/mcdmp_ds_opt1:protect-govern-monetize-enterprise-data-assets-on-premise-and-in-the-cloud}}
Digital economy demands more than just protecting and managing enterprise data. Businesses need to take charge of their data assets, whether on premise or in the cloud, and govern data using a single point of control that offers unified user experience, simplified interfaces for higher productivity and flexibility to address upcoming business requirements by quickly creating, integrating and deploying new solutions.


\section{INTRODUCING LOOM - THE VERITAS MULTI-CLOUD DATA MANAGEMENT PLATFORM}
\label{\detokenize{col/ds/mcdmp_ds_opt1:introducing-loom-the-veritas-multi-cloud-data-management-platform}}
Veritas Loom is a Multi-Cloud Data Management platform that offers enterprises a complete end to end solution to enable enterprise data asset governance with patent pending technology that is highly scalable, flexible, reliable and extensible with multi-tenancy in-built. It comprises of the state-of \textendash{}the art Information Management platform, Dashboard and Developer resources bundled with Veritas and 3rd party applications delivered via Marketplace to address the enterprise need for data protection, governance and monetization of data assets on-premise as well as in the cloud.


\section{PERFORMANCE, SECURITY \& COMPLIANCE}
\label{\detokenize{col/ds/mcdmp_ds_opt1:performance-security-compliance}}
This section will list information related to scale of data that the Loom core services can handle in terms of concurrent users, tenants, application workloads, rate of data analyzed, classified, data scan and other jobs completed per hour. In addition, it can also share information regarding the security and compliance standards that the product adheres to.


\section{LOOM DEPLOYMENT MODELS}
\label{\detokenize{col/ds/mcdmp_ds_opt1:loom-deployment-models}}
Veritas Loom  offers a flexible deployment model to suit enterprise business needs and budgets. It is designed and validated to support (TBD based on actuals from Engineering) say Exabytes of data, thousands of concurrent accesses and more - TBD. Enterprises can use any of the supported deployment models listed below:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\sphinxstylestrong{On Premise:} Enterprises with heavy investment in an on-premise infrastructure and stringent privacy requirements could choose this model and set up the control as well as data planes within their firewall.

\item {} 
\sphinxstylestrong{Cloud Deployment:} Veritas Loom can be setup either in a private cloud deployment model or as a multi-tenanted MSP setup which can be used by several customers such as small enterprises who do not wish to make any infrastructure investments.

\item {} 
\sphinxstylestrong{Hybrid:} Depending upon the business needs, enterprises could choose to setup the Loom Control plane on premise while the data planes can reside in the cloud for scale and efficiency.

\end{itemize}
