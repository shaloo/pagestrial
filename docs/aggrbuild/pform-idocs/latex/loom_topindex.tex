Welcome to Loom Documenation!

If you are looking for the latest working set of Loom Documents under development, please refer to the section titled {\hyperref[\detokenize{loom_topindex:loom-latest-docset}]{\sphinxcrossref{\DUrole{std,std-ref}{Latest Loom Documents under development}}}}.  Loom Documentation corresponding to released version of Loom Platform and its applications is available in the section titled {\hyperref[\detokenize{loom_topindex:loom-release-docset}]{\sphinxcrossref{\DUrole{std,std-ref}{Released Loom Documenatation}}}}.

Loom Documenation is inspired by and totally based on open source Sphinx documentation Engine.  Loom Documentation processes, how-to and other resources for Loom Documentation contributors can be referred to in \sphinxhref{http://docx.cicd.veritas.com/all\_mcdmp\_docx\_res.html\#docx-res}{DocX: Resources}.

The Loom team is trying out this new agile, cutting edge industry process of shared documentation development model following the footsteps of Software Industry leaders such as Microsoft, Google, AWS and many others who have open sourced their documents and involve community in keeping the documents current.  As a first step, we are keeping Loom document development open to all team members of Loom and CBU division.  In future, we plan to open this to wider contributors from within the Veritas community.  We may open it up to third party Loom Application developers outside Veritas if business demands the same.

The following table lists Loom Documentation corresponding to prior internal releases of the product.  Information contained therein may or may not reflect lastet Loom Product under development. For latest set of Loom documents under development, please refer to {\hyperref[\detokenize{loom_topindex:loom-latest-docset}]{\sphinxcrossref{\DUrole{std,std-ref}{Latest Loom Documents under development}}}}.

Here is the archive containing Loom Documentation corresponding to Loom Releases made so far - \DUrole{xref,std,std-ref}{loom\_archive}.


\chapter{Latest Loom Documents under development}
\label{\detokenize{loom_topindex:latest-loom-documents-under-development}}\label{\detokenize{loom_topindex:loom-latest-docset}}
These documents comprise of the complete Loom Documentation Set. These correspond to the latest develop branch of product and documentation sources.  During Loom Product development, the documents are also being developed in tandem (where possible). Loom documentation is part of Loom build and common CICD processes. These documents under development are refreshed on a periodic basis as new content is checked into the Veritas source code repository. At times, you may see some links which are not working or break as part of continous development and validation.  We request to be patient and refer to older stable released document versions, if that helps.

The readers are requested to share their feedback by opening a Jira ticket with “DocX:” in the ticket summary description. At this point in time, all Loom team members are invited to participate in reviewing and refining the product documentation in order to keep them accurate and help early Loom adopters.

Please note, the information here may be incomplete as we are building the documents along with the Loom Product itself.  By Beta timeframe, we plan to capture 80\% of the product documentation.  All end user facing documents will be 100\% complete by GA timeframe.  For GA only English language is supported.  In future, localization in EU and other languages will be executed based on customer requirements and insights from TFE and PM organizations.

\section{Loom Platform Developer Documentation}
\label{\detokenize{loom_topindex:loom-platform-developer-documentation}}
The following set of Loom documents are targeted at Loom Developers and Loom Application Developers. Until we decide to expose Loom Platform and its SDK APIs to 3rd party Loom Application developers, these documents will primarily be meant for \sphinxstyleemphasis{internal-to-Veritas} usage. Also, for the very first release, Loom Deployment is a controlled process so we do not plan to share the Loom Deployment Guide outside Veritas. Much of this documentation will not require any localization support for the initial releases of Loom.  These documents are owned by Loom Platform Team, Vibhu Pratap, Shrikant Joshi and by the Loom DevOps team, Dinesh J Naganna, Prakash S.
